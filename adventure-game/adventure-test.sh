Gecko was 3,395 years old and had seen it all. Throughout the three millenia he lived, he looked for weary souls to teach the art of magic to. It didn't matter how old, what walk of life, or the color of their toenail. But whoever he chose, there was a certain fire within that individual that could shine up the entire earth--that is, if they so wished!\n

On a frosty morning at the Pinebush hiking range, you ($USER) walk down the trail. You have just received a lavish job offer at Amazon as a DevOps engineer. With a 6-figure salary, PTO, and bonuses, you were very stoked and decided to go on a hiking trip to celebrate.  \n

As you continue down the trail, you suddenly notice a man sitting atop a boulder. Clad in bergundy robe, holding a staff and deep silver hair...


Is this danger? Or is this mere hallucination?\n
